- [Bower webhook] - Compile, Publish & Push all from a simple webhook.
- [Test Runner Gutter] - Run any test suite continously and review the results as you write your test.
- [Check-in] - A competing checkout system that is simplistic and futuristic.
- [Travis Keeper] - Manager your travis.yml with ease by automatically updating your file with the lastest version of your environment. Like [greenkeeper.io] but for [travis-ci]
